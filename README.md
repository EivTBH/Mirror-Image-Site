# Mirror-Image-Site
A site I coded for college. . All images are placeholder and the rights belong to their original creators. I have a sister app that matches the site in another repository.

This is the first time i've used HTML since myspace and i've never touched stylesheets and javascript. My JS was tidied up by a lecturer, so credit goes to him for how neat it is.

Again, this is a fictional company and the photographer portraits and profiles are AI driven.
